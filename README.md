# Responsive Nav Bar
The responsive navigation bar was created using the following;

- HTML5
- CSS
- [Font Awesome
](https://fontawesome.com/) 

During its creation, I learned new things, they are as follow;

- We need to set a width to `<i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt"></i>` to make it look good on the screen.
- Mobile devices do not have a `:hover` state.
